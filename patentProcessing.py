This application is a continuation application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/837,335 which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/837,458 filed Aug. 11, 2006, which are is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.
INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
All publications and patent applications mentioned in this specification are herein incorporated by reference to the same extent as if each individual publication or patent application was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
The invention relates generally to dynamic spine prostheses. In particular, the invention relates to dynamic spine prostheses with components whose position with respect to a spine fixation element may be adjusted.
There are multiple types of spine modification devices that may be implanted by attachment to one or more vertebrae to treat a variety of disorders. For example, spinal fusion systems fix the spatial relationships between two or more vertebrae. One such system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,080,156. Fusion systems, such as the one shown in the '156 patent, are typically attached to the vertebrae by screws placed in the pedicle. Because all components of such fusion systems are essentially immobile with respect to each other, each component must continually bear and transmit to adjacent components all forces exerted on the device anywhere in the device until the treated vertebral bodies have fused, at which point the bony fusion generally absorbs the majority of the intervertebral loads. Because such fusion devices are typically utilized in conjunction with other fusion-promoting techniques and tools, such as disc evacuation and packing with bone graft, the use of interbody fusion cages and bone graft, gutter grafting and/or the use of BMP or other arthrodesis promoting tools and techniques, it is generally only necessary for such fusion devices to function for a limited amount of time before the arthrodesis assumes the majority of the vertebral loading.
Unlike fusion systems, however, dynamic spine prostheses attach to two or more vertebrae and have components that move with respect to each other as the vertebrae to which they are attached move. Moreover, dynamic spine prostheses should be designed to assume normal physiological loading (as well as transient excessive loading conditions) for the lifetime of the patient, which could easily exceed 10,000,000 cycles or more. Dynamic spine prostheses can include artificial facet joint prostheses (such as, e.g., the Total Facet Arthroplasty System® available from Archus Orthopedics, Inc., the AFRS system available from Facet Solutions, and the TOPS system available from Impliant, Ltd.) as well as dynamic stabilization systems (such as, e.g., the Stabilimax NZ system available from Applied Spine Technologies, the Axient system available from Innovative Spinal Technologies, the N-Flex system available from N-Spine, and the Accuflex system available from Globus Medical.) and dynamic interspinous-spacer systems (such as, e.g., the X-Stop system available from Kyphon/St. Francis Medical Technologies, the Coflex system available from Paradigm Spine, the Extensure system available from Nuvasive, and the Wallis system available from Abbott Spine.).
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
Due to patient to patient differences in spinal anatomy as well as to anatomical changes caused by a particular patient's disease state, the relationship between the fixation elements (such as screws, posts, etc.) of a dynamic spine prosthesis to the remaining components of the prosthesis may vary from patient to patient and from disease state to disease state. However, unlike spinal fusion prosthesis, the connections between the fixation elements and the dynamic (or motion-allowing) elements of a dynamic spine prosthesis must be capable of withstanding repetitive loading (both normal physiological loading as well as transient excessive loading) for the remaining lifetime of the patient. The invention therefore provides an adjustable connection between a dynamic spine prosthesis fixation element and other components of the prosthesis which is capable of withstanding such loading for an extended period of time, up to, and including, the lifetime of the patient and/or the implant. Moreover, because physicians will also often desire the fixation elements to be placed in a desired location and/or orientation relative to the surrounding anatomical structures (such as to increase the strength of the of the fixation by maximizing cortical bone purchase and/or to accommodate unusual or size-constrained anatomical features), and such positioning is often non-optimal for the placement of the dynamic elements of the device, the present invention allows the physician to place the fixation elements in virtually any orientation or position, and then securely fix the properly-functioning implant relative to the location and/or orientation of the fixation members.
The invention relates generally to implantable devices, apparatus or mechanisms that are suitable for implantation within a human body to restore, augment, and/or replace hard tissue, soft tissue and/or connective tissue, including bone and cartilage, and systems for treating the anatomic or functional manifestation of injury or diseases, such as spinal pathologies. In some instances, the implantable devices can include devices designed to replace missing, removed, or resected body parts or structure. The implantable devices, apparatus or mechanisms are configured such that the devices can be formed from parts, elements or components which alone or in combination comprise the device. The implantable devices can also be configured such that one or more elements or components are formed integrally to achieve a desired physiological, operational or functional result such that the components complete the device. Functional results can include the surgical restoration and functional power of a joint, controlling, limiting or altering the functional power of a joint, and/or eliminating the functional power of a joint by preventing joint motion. Portions of the device can be configured to replace or augment existing anatomy and/or implanted devices, and/or be used in combination with resection or removal of existing anatomical structure.
One aspect of the invention provides a dynamic spine prosthesis (such as, for example, a facet joint prosthesis having an articulation surface configured to articulate with a corresponding facet joint element) that has a fixation element with an elongated bone entry portion defining a longitudinal axis and a dynamic spine prosthesis component connected to the fixation element at a connection location by an adjustable connection. The adjustable connection has first and second washers each rotatably supported by the fixation element and each having an angled contact surface in a plane not perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the fixation element, with the connection location being between the bone entry portion and the first and second washers.
In some embodiments, the angled contact surfaces of the first and second washers are in contact with each other. There also may be a third washer between the dynamic spine prosthesis connection location and the bone entry portion, with the third washer comprising a partial spherical surface.
In some embodiments, the dynamic spine prosthesis also has a tightening element (such as, e.g., a compression nut) having a first position enabling movement between the first and second washers and the fixation element and a second position preventing movement between the washers and the fixation element.
In some embodiments, the adjustable connection also has a structural attachment element supporting the dynamic spine prosthesis component, with the structural attachment element having a first position in which the dynamic spine prosthesis component is movable with respect to the structural element and a second position in which the dynamic spine prosthesis component is fixed with respect to the structural element.
Another aspect of the invention provides a method of adjusting a position of a component of a dynamic spine prosthesis (such as a facet joint prosthesis having an articulation surface configured to articulate with a corresponding facet joint element) with respect to a bone fixation element supporting the dynamic spine prosthesis. The method includes the steps of inserting a bone entry portion of the fixation element into a vertebra; moving the dynamic spine prosthesis component to a desired position with respect to a connection location between the dynamic spine prosthesis component and the fixation element, the connection location being between the bone entry portion and first and second washers, the first and second washers each having an angled contact surface in a plane not perpendicular to a longitudinal axis of the fixation element and being supported by the fixation element; rotating the first washer with respect to the second washer; and immobilizing the washers and the dynamic spine prosthesis component with respect to the fixation element.
In some embodiments, the method includes the step of rotating the second washer with respect to the fixation element.
In some embodiments, the step of moving the dynamic spine prosthesis component includes the step of moving the dynamic spine prosthesis component with respect to a support disposed at the connection location. In some embodiments, the immobilizing step may include the step of immobilizing the dynamic spine prosthesis component with respect to the support, such as by tightening a compression nut threadably mounted on an extension of the fixation element."""},

FIELD OF THE INVENTION
This invention relates to devices and methods for the fixation and stabilization of orthopedic fractures. More specifically, these devices and methods apply to stabilization of compression fractures of spinal vertebrae.
BACKGROUND
The mammalian spine consists of bones called vertebrae, which are separated by soft cushions referred to as intervertebral discs. The thick portion of bone at the front of each vertebra is referred to as the vertebral body. When a vertebral body collapses, a vertebral compression fracture (VCF) of the bone results. Most vertebral compression fractures are caused by osteoporosis, a disease that causes bones to become brittle and to break easily. Because osteoporosis usually progresses without obvious symptoms, an individual may not be aware that he or she has the disease until a fracture actually occurs. The pain and loss of movement that often accompanies fractures of the spine are perhaps the most feared and debilitating side effects of osteoporosis. When a spinal compression fracture occurs as a result of osteoporosis, the vertebrae in the thoracic (chest) and lower spine that are usually affected. For many people with osteoporosis a spinal fracture results in severely limited activity, constant pain and serious reduction in quality of life.
While there is no known cure for osteoporosis, there are treatments and prevention measures available to reduce the risk of pathologic fractures. The three mainstays of osteoporosis treatment are (1) weight-bearing exercise; (2) nutrition supplementation such as supplemental calcium; and (3) medications such as bisphosphonates, calcitonin, raloxifene and estrogen. Despite such treatments approximately 700,000 vertebral compression fractures occur each year, usually in women over the age of 60, and it has been estimated that at least 25 percent of women and a somewhat smaller percentage of men over the age of 50 will suffer one or more spinal fractures.
Other medical conditions known to contribute to vertebral compression fractures include cancer, benign tumors or lesions and various types of trauma. Cancerous lesions include multiple myeloma and metastatic lesions, including those arising from breast or lung cancer, or lymphoma, while benign lesions include hemangioma and giant cell tumors. Additionally, younger individuals may also suffer such vertebral compression fractures, particularly individuals whose bones have become fragile due to the long-term use of steroids or other drugs to treat a variety of diseases such as lupus, asthma and rheumatoid arthritis.
Various treatments are currently available for spinal compression fractures and such fractures may also be treated symptomatically with pain medicines. While various types of back bracing devices can also be used, such devices may actually cause weakening of the bone and predispose patients to further fractures in the future. If a compression fracture is caused by trauma, a rigid bracing that protects the bone as it heals may be required for six to ten weeks.
Many cases of vertebral compression fractures require surgery. When the compression fracture is caused by a tumor, a biopsy procedure may be performed followed by treatment of the tumor. A surgical procedure may also be required to remove any bone within the spinal canal, followed by the fusing together of the vertebra in order to stabilize the spine. Surgery is almost always required whenever there is a loss of function caused by the impingement of bone on the spinal cord or spinal nerves.
Recently, minimally invasive techniques, such as percutaneous vertebroplasty, have been used to treat compression fractures. Vertebroplasty is an image-guided, minimally invasive, non-surgical procedure used to strengthen a fractured spinal vertebra. Often performed on an outpatient basis, such procedures are normally carried out with the patient immobilized lying face down on his or her stomach while under local anesthesia and light sedation and intravenous antibiotics may also be administered to prevent infection. Then, through a small incision and under the guidance of a special x-ray imaging technique a cannulated bone needle designed for intraosseous access is guided through the skin and passed through the spinal muscles until the needle tip is precisely positioned within the fractured vertebra. At this point the interventional radiologist may perform an examination called intraosseous venography to insure that the bone needle has resides in the desired area within the fractured bone. Finally, biocompatible liquid orthopedic cement is injected through the bone needle to fill the vertebral cavity and as the needle is withdrawn, the cement hardens thereby stabilizing the vertebra and thus preventing further vertebral body collapse.
Although successful vertebroplasty has been shown to alleviate the pain caused by a compression fracture, these techniques are often deficient providing adequate stability and physiologic reconstruction of the spinal column and often prevents patients from return to a previous level of physical activity.
In vertebroplasty the most commonly used bone cements are curable compositions of poly(methyl methacrylate) containing radiopacifiers such as barium powder that render the cement visible by the same imaging technique used to guide the bone needle. It is evident that as the technology matures and become more sophisticated, there is a need for better visualization techniques to perform such complicated and delicate procedures since X-ray (fluoroscopic) guidance is the only available modality for visualization during the performance of vertebroplasty to date. Although a variety of direct visualization techniques including optical visualization (endoscopes), ultrasonography, and laser beams are well known in the art, to date these techniques have been used only in body cavities other than bony tissue.
Another minimally invasive treatment for spinal compression fractures is the balloon-assisted vertebroplasty technique known as balloon kyphoplasty. In a kyphoplasty procedure, as in a percutaneous vertebroplasty procedure, a cement-like material is injected directly into the fractured bone, however kyphoplasty includes an additional step the goal of which is to restore height to the bone thus reducing deformity of the spine. In a balloon kyphoplasty procedure an inflatable orthopedic balloon is inserted between the pieces of a collapsed vertebra and the balloon is carefully inflated to gently raise the collapsed vertebra and return it to a more normal position while the inner soft bone is compacted to create a cavity inside the vertebral body. The balloon is then deflated and removed and pasty orthopedic cement is injected through a bone needle to fill the vertebral cavity wherein the cement hardens to stabilize the raised vertebra and prevent further vertebral body collapse. However, as in the vertebroplasty procedures, balloon kyphoplasty techniques are often insufficient in providing adequate stability and physiologic reconstruction of the spinal column and often prevents patients from return to a previous level of physical activity.
Whereas the percutaneous vertebroplasty procedures discussed above are well described and widely accepted, osteoplasty of bones outside the spine is less known but is being actively studied. For example, a clinical study published by Hierholzer et al. in Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology, vol. 14, pp. 773-778 (2003) describes patients with painful metastases to the pelvis, ilium, or femur who were successfully treated by injection of acrylic cement into the osteolytic defect under fluoroscopic or computed tomographic (CT) guidance. Therefore, it is expected that percutaneous osteoplasty of bones outside the spine will become widely accepted.
Devices for delivering injectable biomaterials such as bone cement formulations into body cavities are known in the art. U.S. Pat. No. 7,008,433 to Voellmicke et al. describes a high-pressure bone cement injection device for use in vertebroplasty that allows for specific control of the injection of small discrete quantities of the cement. Published U.S. Pat. Application No. 2006/0074433 to McGill et al. describes an apparatus for delivering bone cement into a vertebra that includes a cannula and a pressurized delivery device in communication with the cannula. This pressurized delivery device provides an actuating force that acts either directly or through a medium to cause a flowable compound to be delivered from the delivery device to the cannula and into the vertebra. While the above referenced devices address problems relating to the viscosity of flowable compositions such as bone cements, they do not address issues relating to the precise control of placement and distribution of such compositions at a targeted injection site.
U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,019,776 and 6,033,411 to Preissman, et al. disclose methods for a controlled approach to the interior of a vertebral body involving insertion of a threaded or sharp-pointed stylet and cannula percutaneously through the soft tissue of a patient until hard tissue is abutted; further insertion of the stylet to a predetermined site within the hard tissue; ratcheting a pawl mechanism or rotating a camming mechanism to advance the cannula along the stylet to the predetermined site; withdrawing the stylet from the cannula and attaching a source of implantable material for injection of the material into the site through the cannula. U.S. Pat. No. 6,676,663 to Higueras et al. describes an applicator device utilizing a standard syringe body for controllably injecting a quantity of cement into bones, particularly, in percutaneous vertebroplasty. However, the devices described in these patents deliver the injected material only through the tip of cannula and therefore offer no control of the direction or distribution of the injected material within the organism. Furthermore, these patents do not teach methods for delivery of restorative material by percutaneous vertebroplasty by which multiple doses of material can be injected.
A report by Heini et al. in SPINE, vol. 27, No. 1, pp. 105-109 (2002) describes the evaluation of an injection cannula for the delivery of bone cement in vertebroplasty procedures using human cadaver bones, wherein the injection cannula has a single opening in the cannula wall through which the bone cement is dispensed. These researchers indicate that use of a side-opening cannula may reduce the likelihood of cement leakage into adjacent veins and subsequent embolization. However, such a cannula with a single opening in the cannula wall as described does not provide sufficient control of cement placement nor degree of directional control required to prevent extravasation in these delicate procedures.
U.S. Pat. No. 4,959,058 to Michelson describes a cannula for use with an arthroscope wherein the cannula has multiple openings in the form of multiple narrow slots radially disposed about the tip. These openings are designed to allow a low viscosity fluid such as water to be injected in a shower-like fashion as a viewing aid during the arthroscopic procedure. Such a cannula is not suitable for the injection of viscous flowable materials such as bone cement and, since the narrow openings are confined near the tip of the cannula, such a design offers no control over the placement of the fluid.
Bone screws for spinal compression fractures are well know in the art. Furthermore, U.S. Pat. No. 7,255,713 to Malek describes cannulated bone screws for delivering a treatment agent to a bone or a prosthetic vertebral body. U.S. Pat. No. 6,214,012 to Kartman et al. also describes a cannulated bone screw, which is configured for delivery of an injectable material into a bone. U.S. Pat. No. 4,653,489 to Tronzo et al. describes a fenestrated cannulated hip screw adapted for introduction of bone cement into a bone region for increase of overall fixation of hip fractures.
Various mechanical devices for the fixation and stabilization of various orthopedic fractures are know in the art. For example, US Patent Application 2003/0171812 to Grunberg et al. describes a modular support implant device consisting of a plurality of rigid plates for reconstructing and supporting a diseased or fractured bone or within a space previously occupied by a diseased intervertebral dis. The individual plates are sized to be inserted into the bone or the space through a cannula and are arranged in situ relative the adjacent plates to construct a scaffold that to function as a supporting prosthesis. US Patent Application 2003/0074075 to James et al. describes expandable implants for orthopedic uses wherein the implants are inserted into an annular defect by forceps or forcep-like implantation devices.
Therefore, in view of the prior art, there exists a need for devices and methods that permit effective delivery of a mechanical implant such as a scaffold into a bone cavity with concurrent or sequential delivery of a flowable material such as bone cement and wherein the mechanical implant is secured by an anchoring means.
There also exists a need for devices and methods for the securing the bone screws used in orthopedic procedures such as fracture fixation.
There exists a need for a reliable integrated system for fracture fixation and other such procedures that integrates the delivery of mechanical implants and introduction of bone cement wherein the system also functions to secure bone screws used in the procedure.
There exist yet other needs to provide minimally invasive techniques for the reparation and restoration of bony structures and to provide minimally invasive techniques for the augmentation of procedures requiring screw fixation.
The devices and methods of the present invention address these and other needs that will become apparent to those skilled in the art based on the following specification and the accompanying drawings.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
The present invention provides a reliable integrated system for fracture fixation and other such procedures wherein the delivery of mechanical implants and introduction of flowable compositions such as bone cement into an intraosseous space are integrated. The devices and methods are useful anywhere in the axial or peripheral skeleton of a mammalian body. The systems comprise cannulated orthopedic screws and mechanical expandable implants introducible through the lumen of such screws wherein the system is configured such that the expandable proximal end of the implant remains attached to the cannulated screw to provide an anchor for the implant. In preferred embodiments the cannulated implants are expandable within the intraosseous space to introduce a scaffold-like structure such as branched, basket, mesh umbrella and the like and wherein after subsequent introduction of a flowable composition such as bone cement the device functions to secure the bone screw and prevents the subsequent post-operative loosening of bone screws often observed months or years after the fixation procedure. The devices are also particularly useful for delivering flowable restorative compositions into an osseous cavity.
A typical embodiment of an orthopedic fracture fixation device of the present invention comprises a cannulated orthopedic screw comprising a through-bore along the longitudinal axis that defines an orthopedic screw lumen extending between an open orthopedic screw proximal end and an open orthopedic screw distal end; a screw cap attachable to the orthopedic screw proximal end that functions to seal the orthopedic screw proximal end; and a cannulated implant sized and configured to be slidably disposable within the through-bore of the orthopedic screw wherein the cannulated implant distal end comprises an expandable region that is disposed beyond the orthopedic screw distal end when the cannulated implant proximal end is disposed completely within the orthopedic screw through-bore and wherein the expandable region of the cannulated implant is expanded to assume a predetermined configuration when disposed within a targeted location in a mammalian body. The combination of the implanted structure and the bone cement stabilize the fractured bone.
This devices of the present invention are useful for treatment and stabilization of malignant or traumatic vertebral compression fracture of the spine and the combination of the nitinol implanted structure and the bone cement stabilizes and reconstructs the affected vertebra.
Certain embodiments of the present invention employ cannulated screws with side ports or holes wherein a pre-shaped expandable implant in a compressed state is inserted inside the cannulated screw and branch-like elements of the implant situated along the shaft of the implant are extend outside of the screw through the sides ports for additional stabilization. Such devices are particularly useful in spinal procedures or in treatment of fractures of long bones like tibia wherein it is desirable to prevent loosening of the screws.
Also in accordance with the present invention, there are provided devices and methods for dispensing flowable compositions into cavities that exist in or that can be formed or created in bones. More particularly the invention provides devices and methods for injecting a flowable composition such as bone cement into an interior region of a vertebral body."""}
